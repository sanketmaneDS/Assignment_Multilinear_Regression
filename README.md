# Assignment_Multilinear_Regression
This repository contains notebook introducing reader to basic concepts of multilinear regression and its application.

1) Consider only the below columns and prepare a prediction model for predicting Price.

Corolla<-Corolla[c("Price","Age_08_04","KM","HP","cc","Doors","Gears","Quarterly_Tax","Weight")]

Model -- model of the car

Price  -- Offer Price in EUROs	

Age_08_04 -- Age in months as in August 2004	

KM -- Accumulated Kilometers on odometer

HP -- Horse Power

cc -- Cylinder Volume in cubic centimeters

Doors -- Number of doors

Cylinders	-- Number of cylinders

Gears -- Number of gear positions

Quarterly_Tax -- Quarterly road tax in EUROs

Weight -- Weight in Kilograms



2) 
Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_startups data.
Do transformations for getting better predictions of profit and
make a table containing R^2 value for each prepared model.

R&D Spend -- Research and devolop spend in the past few years
Administration -- spend on administration in the past few years
Marketing Spend -- spend on Marketing in the past few years
State -- states from which data is collected
Profit  -- profit of each state in the past few years
